**INT. THE VOID - CYBERSPACE**

We zoom INTO the tablet screen. The world dissolves into code, then reassembles into a breathtaking digital landscape.

**NARRATOR (V.O.)**
> The first hurdle was the face of the machine. It couldn't be static. It had to be fluid. Alive.

A woman materializes from the pixels. It is **SCARLETT JOHANSSON**. She glows with an ethereal, UI-blue light.

> GENERATIVE UI (SCARLETT)
> (Voice smooth, intelligent)
> Welcome, user. I am the Generative UI Module. I do not have a default setting. I am whatever you need me to be.

**INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - CONTINUOUS**

The Suits stare at the screen. One of them adjusts his glasses.

> KAI
> You see that? That's not a JPEG. That's a **Neuro-Synaptic Aesthetic Prediction**. She just read your mind.

> SUIT #2
> Is that... Scarlett Johansson?

> KAI
> Legally distinct digital avatar! But yes. She's running the `001_generative_ui_background` protocol. 

**EXT. CYBERSPACE - CONTINUOUS**

Generative UI (Scarlett) waves her hand. The background behind her shifts from a corporate office to a serene forest, then to a cyberpunk alleyway, matching the mood of the room.

> GENERATIVE UI
> I employ a Multi-Modal Generative AI Synthesis Engine. You speak your desire, I transmute it into visual reality. "A bank vault made of clouds."

Instantly, the background morphs into a fluffy, secure cloud-vault.

> GENERATIVE UI
> My latent space navigation is hyper-efficient. I optimize for semantic fidelity.

**INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - CONTINUOUS**

> KAI
> She optimizes fidelity! Do you know how hard it is to optimize fidelity?! Rock, tell 'em.

> THE ROCK
> It is extremely difficult.

> KAI
> Exactly! This isn't just a pretty face. It's a system. A Comprehensive System for Ontological Transmutation.

Kai taps the screen frantically.

> KAI
> But a pretty face isn't enough. You need brains. You need context. You need... Tony Stark.

> SUIT #1
> You have Tony Stark?

> KAI
> Better. I have his algorithm.
