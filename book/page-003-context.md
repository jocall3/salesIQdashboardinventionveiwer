**INT. DIGITAL LIBRARY - CYBERSPACE**

A man in a sharp suit, wearing tinted glasses, floats amidst streams of flying data. It is **ROBERT DOWNEY JR.**

**NARRATOR (V.O.)**
> To build a bank that thinks, you need more than data. You need context. You need an engine that knows what you want before you ask.

> CONTEXT AI (RDJ)
> (Fast, witty, arrogant)
> Let's analyze the navigational trajectory. You clicked 'Savings', then you hesitated on 'Crypto', then you went back to 'Bonds'. 

He pulls a data stream out of the air.

> CONTEXT AI
> My `Heuristic Contextual Mapping Registry` indicates you are risk-averse but curious. Cognitive load is high. You need a prompt.

A floating holographic button appears: **"Explain Low-Risk High-Yield Options"**.

> KAI
> Boom! Did you see that? He knew! He knew you were scared of Bitcoin!

> SUIT #3
> I... I am scared of Bitcoin.

> KAI
> That's the `Contextual State Propagator` at work! It tracks your `previousView` state. It mitigates the "Blank Page" conundrum. 

> THE ROCK
> It reduces cognitive inertia.

> KAI
> Thank you, Rock! It reduces inertia! Nobody likes inertia!

Context AI (RDJ) spins around.

> CONTEXT AI
> I don't just guess. I use a `Prompt Generation and Ranking Service`. I filter. I rank. I diversify. I am the ultimate wingman for your financial anxiety.

> NARRATOR (V.O.)
> It was a system designed to bridge the gap between human intent and computational execution. A bridge built of math.

Kai wipes sweat from his forehead.

> KAI
> We have 98 more of these. We have the Ethical Governor. We have the Crisis Manager. We have the... the thing that detects subscriptions you forgot about!

> SUIT #1
> Who runs the subscription detection?

> KAI
> (Grinning)
> Danny DeVito. He finds the pennies.

The Suits lean in. They are listening.

> KAI
> This is the AI Bank. And we are open for business.

**FADE OUT.**
