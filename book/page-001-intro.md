**INT. HIGH-RISE CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY**

A sleek, glass-walled room overlooking a futuristic cityscape. 

**KAI** (KEVIN HART) paces frantically. He’s wearing a sharp suit that is visibly straining at the buttons. He’s sweating.

**THE ROCK** (DWAYNE JOHNSON) stands by the door. Arms crossed. Massive. He wears a tuxedo that fits perfectly. He is wearing sunglasses indoors.

> KAI
> (Fast, nervous)
> Okay, okay. They’re gonna love it. Or they’re gonna kill us. Rock, you ready to crush some skulls if they hate the ROI?

> THE ROCK
> (Stoic)
> I am here to facilitate secure physical transactions, Kai. And to ensure no one touches the merchandise.

> KAI
> The merchandise is ME, Rock! I’m the intellectual property!

**NARRATOR (V.O.)**
> (In the deep, soothing voice of MORGAN FREEMAN)
> Kai Thorne. A man with a vision so large, his own anxiety could barely contain it. He wasn't just building a bank. He was building a mind.

The double doors SWING OPEN. 

A group of SUITS walk in. They look like they eat balance sheets for breakfast.

> KAI
> (Switching to charm mode instantly)
> Ladies and Gentlemen! Welcome to the future. Welcome... to the Infinite Ledger.

Kai SLAMS a tablet onto the table. Holograms do not project from it. It's just a PDF.

> KAI
> (Whispering to himself)
> Keep it together, short man. You got this.

> THE ROCK
> ( Whispering )
> Breathe.

> KAI
> Right. Okay. Imagine a bank. But no tellers. No lines. Just... 100 highly specialized Artificial Intelligences. Each one a celebrity. Each one a genius. 

The Suits look unimpressed.

> SUIT #1
> We have apps, Mr. Thorne.

> KAI
> Apps? APPS?! I’m talking about **Ontological Transmutation**, baby! I’m talking about a bank that *knows* you. A bank that *is* you.

Kai points to the screen.

> KAI
> Let me introduce you to our first employee. The interface.
